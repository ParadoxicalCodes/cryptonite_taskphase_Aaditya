# Matching with *
"*" when put in an argument acts as a wildcard (or empty slot which is filled with all possible combinations allowed by dir or command it is in)
# Matching with ?
"?" works the same as "*" but for a single character. The latter fills as many empty places as possible while former does it for just one place
# Mathcing with []
again "[]" similar  "?" but it looks for characters in word inside the brackets individually
