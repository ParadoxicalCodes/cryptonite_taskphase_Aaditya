# Hello Hackers
### Learnt about what we see when the terminal is booted up and what each part of the shell line means. For eg: " hacker@dojo:~$ " this is a prompt and each segment of it means something.
### hacker = username
### dojo = hostname of the machine shell
### $ = an indicator that a user is running the terminal than the owner/admin

## Intro to Commands
### executed the commands whoami and hello
### also learnt about the fact that commands are case sensitives i.e. hello and HELLO are not the same

## Intro to Arguments
### in the input, first word is the command while the rest are arguments. Command echo just returns whatever the argument is as output. (kind of like print function in python  not exactly the same ofc)
