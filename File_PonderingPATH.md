>While solving this i was slightly confused that if i do PATH="" would remove everything then how would /challenge/run run? is it not possible to specifically remove rm from PATH?

also echo $PATH allows us to look into what dirs are there already

this is how you put a dir for a cmd to run (but as we can other dirs are gone isnt that an issue?)

# Hijacking commands
